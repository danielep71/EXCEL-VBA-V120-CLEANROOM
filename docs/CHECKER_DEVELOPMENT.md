# 🧩 Checker Development Contract

`tools/check_repo.py` remains the canonical portable checker delivered to generated repositories. **The single-file identity rule applies to that canonical checker only.** Its reviewed source is the distributable artifact, so there is no bundle transform that can drift from source. Focused sibling gates are development/runtime tools within the repository and may share private standard-library infrastructure.

## 🔧 Shared focused-gate primitives

`tools/_gatelib.py` owns the small cross-tool mechanics that are genuinely identical: Git subprocess wrappers, tracked-file enumeration, deterministic UTF-8/LF report writes, the common `--root` / `--output` / `--summary` / `--self-test` parser, and `run_gate`, the typed runner that owns the shared console, evidence and exit-code contract. Focused gates import those primitives instead of maintaining copies. Tool-specific `run_check`, `build_report`, `run_self_test`, semantic rules, fixtures and Markdown renderers remain local because their behavior and evidence schemas differ.

### `run_gate` ownership

`run_gate` centralizes only the orchestration that was provably identical across gates: self-test dispatch, report construction, canonical JSON serialization, Markdown summary writing, console output, and the `0` / `1` / `2` exit mapping. It never widens a gate's exception handling. Each caller passes its own operational-exception tuple, so a programming error still surfaces as a traceback instead of being reported as exit code `2`.

Gates that historically evaluated `--self-test` outside their operational handler reported failures as `SELF-TEST ERROR`; gates that evaluated it inside reported `ERROR`. `run_gate` preserves both wordings through `self_test_error_prefix`.

The complete registry is `GATE_RUNNER_CONSUMERS` and `GATE_RUNNER_EXCLUSIONS` in
[`checker_development.py`](../tools/checker_development.py). Its report lists
every consumer and each exclusion's reason. Keep that executable registry as
the maintained list rather than duplicating a table that misses later gates.

`ownership_scan` checks focused tools other than `_gatelib.py` and the canonical
checker. Every top-level `main` in that scope must be a declared consumer or
exclusion; adding a gate without updating the declaration fails the contract,
as does an excluded tool quietly adopting the runner. The canonical checker is
excluded separately by its self-contained import contract. Sixteen independent
runner tests cover CLI flags, defaults/help, self-test dispatch, diagnostic
prefixes, exit mapping, deterministic evidence, write failures and propagation
of non-operational exceptions.

`tools/check_repo.py` must never import `_gatelib.py`. Generated repositories retain `_gatelib.py` for the focused operational gates, while the canonical checker remains independently copyable and executable as one standard-library-only file. `checker_development.py` enforces this ownership boundary in the canonical template. The checker-development workflow, this document, and the `policy_coverage_*` semantic-coverage harness are template-maintainer assets and are removed by initialization rather than shipped into generated projects.

The public API gate also uses `check_vba_conditionals.py` to evaluate the same three supported compilation environments. It checks name collisions only where declarations can coexist, and requires one manifest declaration row plus a `# SIG` record for every distinct reachable signature. Unknown conditions fail closed. These are static models, not evidence of Excel runtime certification.

### Self-test interface coverage

Runner ownership and `--self-test` support are separate contracts. The development
report discovers CLI definitions, imported-main wrappers and executable
`__main__` guards (including reversed equality), then checks each
script's `--help`, and requires either an advertised `--self-test` flag or a
non-empty reason in `SELF_TEST_EXCLUSIONS`. Missing declarations, failed help,
stale exclusions, and exclusions for tools that now advertise the flag fail.
The report lists every inspected CLI and its alternative test command or limitation.
Guard discovery preserves `not`, `and` and `or` polarity and literal truth values.
Chained comparisons are modeled as conjunctions of adjacent comparisons; literal
equality and inequality are resolved without executing source.
A guarded branch must be possible in script mode and impossible on import; this
also recognizes a main-only `else` branch. Unknown operands remain unknown, so
this is a bounded syntactic model, not general Python control-flow analysis.

`check_documentation.py` and `check_wiki.py` intentionally use dedicated offline
suites: `python tools/test_documentation.py -v` and `python tools/test_wiki.py -v`.
CI runs them in `static-checks.yml` and `wiki-checks.yml`, respectively. They remain
runner consumers; their self-test exclusions do not exempt them from ownership checks.
The registry also names the separate suites for the other operational CLIs without
the flag and explicitly discloses the provisioning fixture utility's lack of a
dedicated offline suite.

This check verifies interface declarations, not exhaustive test coverage. Advertising
the flag does not prove that its fixtures ran or that every branch is covered.
Executable unittest scripts are included with explicit exclusions identifying their
normal fixture invocation. Non-CLI helper modules remain outside this interface
inventory; suite execution and semantic coverage remain separate. No host execution or release
certification is inferred from synthetic fixtures.

### Supported invocation mode

The supported focused-tool interface is **path execution from the repository checkout**, for example `python3 tools/check_vba_public_api.py --root . --self-test`. Python places the executed script's directory on `sys.path`, which is the declared mechanism by which focused sibling gates resolve the private `_gatelib.py` module.

`python -m tools.<module>` is **not** part of the supported contract: `tools/` is not a public Python package and no package-installation interface is promised. If module-mode execution is added later, it must be introduced deliberately with package-aware imports and fixtures for both invocation modes rather than relying on incidental interpreter path behavior. The canonical `check_repo.py` remains unaffected because it has no sibling import.

## 🧭 Internal boundaries

`tools/checker_development.py` parses the checker with Python AST and requires the following ordered ownership boundaries:

| Section | Sentinel | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime core | `Repository` | repository I/O, findings and common primitives |
| Configuration | `_same_keys` | repository-profile schema and effective requirements |
| Repository policy | `check_required_paths` | generic repository, document, workflow and metadata rules |
| VBA policy | `_vba_paths` | VBE exports, VBA structure, roles, generated contracts and public surface |
| Reporting | `build_report` | deterministic report model, Markdown and console serialization |
| Fixtures | `_write_fixture` | positive/degraded synthetic repository fixtures and self-test |
| CLI | `parse_arguments` | supported command-line surface and exit behavior |

The development check fails if a boundary disappears, changes order, leaves a top-level definition outside the ordered sections, or changes the canonical policy-check sequence without an explicit update to the contract.

## 🧪 Independent tests

Maintainers can exercise parser and reporter behavior without running the full synthetic repository matrix:

```bash
python3 tools/checker_development.py --root . --self-test
```

The contract directly tests representative YAML, GitHub-style Markdown anchors, EditorConfig parsing, VBA lexical stripping, Markdown/console serialization, CLI flags and operational exit-code mapping. The full `check_repo.py --self-test` and semantic policy-coverage matrix remain separate higher-level gates. Hosted CI keeps both template-maintainer contracts together in `checker-development.yml`; the operational `static-checks.yml` deliberately remains free of template-only policy-coverage tooling so the generated workflow is self-contained.

## 📦 Portability and artifact identity

The runtime checker may import only Python standard-library modules and must not use relative imports. No `pip`, package manager, virtual environment, generated package tree or network dependency is required in a generated VBA repository.

Every development-contract report records the SHA-256 of `tools/check_repo.py`. Because the reviewed source and shipped artifact are the same bytes, reproducibility is an identity operation (`build_transform = none`) rather than a hidden build step.

## 🔁 Change procedure

1. Change `tools/check_repo.py`, `_gatelib.py`, and/or the focused gate that owns the affected behavior. Keep `check_repo.py` independent of `_gatelib.py`.
2. Run `python3 tools/checker_development.py --root . --self-test`.
3. Run `python3 tools/check_repo.py --root . --self-test`.
4. Run `python3 tools/check_policy_coverage.py --root . --self-test` so every canonical blocking finding remains exercised.
5. Run the normal repository gate and require successful hosted terminal verdicts from both `Checker development` and `Repository integrity`.
6. If a deliberate internal boundary, CLI contract or canonical check order changes, update this document and `checker_development.py` in the same reviewed change.

## 🚫 Non-goals

This contract does not replace authoritative GitHub Actions validation, Excel/VBA compilation, runtime regression tests, numerical assurance, UI-state tests, release evidence or profile-specific specialist controls.
